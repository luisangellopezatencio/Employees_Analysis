# Employees Analysis

In this project we will be exploring data related to employees. We will be using the [EmployeeData.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sLvCEUOmbL341MApio5RC05nHpgGrq06/view?usp=sharing) dataset which contains information about employees such as: Education, Joinning year, City, Payment tier, current experience, etc.

The objective of this project is to analyze the data and predict if the employee will leave or not.
